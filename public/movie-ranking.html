<h1>EILEEN's BEST EVER M o v i e s </h1>




<h2>Schindler's List</h2><hr><p>Poignant: 
This was the first movie I ever sat through the entire credits. I was so sad and emotional I was not ready to face the ugly humanity outide the theatre walls.
</p>

<h2>The Shack</h2><hr><p>Thought Provoking: It was a planned trip to the movie threatre but no decision was made what to see. We couldnt form a concensus on what to see. 
    We ended up seeing The Shack and I am so glad we did. Religious undertones with non-tradtional roles. This movie put a smile on my face and 
    kept me entertained.
